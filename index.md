# SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge

The dataset contains 33,126 dermoscopic training images of unique benign and malignant skin lesions from over 2,000 patients. Each image is associated with one of these individuals using a unique patient identifier. All malignant diagnoses have been confirmed via histopathology, and benign diagnoses have been confirmed using either expert agreement, longitudinal follow-up, or histopathology. A thorough publication describing all features of this dataset is forthcoming. The dataset can be accessed at: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/data)

The dataset was generated by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) and images are from the following sources: Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona, Medical University of Vienna, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Melanoma Institute Australia, University of Queensland, and the University of Athens Medical School.
