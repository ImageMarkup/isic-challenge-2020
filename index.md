# SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Training Set

The dataset contains 33,126 dermoscopic training images of unique benign and malignant skin lesions from over 2,000 patients. Each image is associated with one of these individuals using a unique patient identifier. All malignant diagnoses have been confirmed via histopathology, and benign diagnoses have been confirmed using either expert agreement, longitudinal follow-up, or histopathology. A thorough publication describing all features of this dataset is forthcoming.
